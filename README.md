# Sudoku Checker

This program reads in a solved sudoku from a file and checks if it has been solved correctly.

A correct sudoku has the following properties (and the program follows this logical reasoning):
* The sudoku has 81 elements.
* The smallest value in the sudoku is 1, and the largest value is 9.
* No row contains any duplicate integers.
* No column contains any duplicate integers.
* No 9x9 square contains any duplicate integers.

I created this program to learn python, especially I/O functionality and list comprehension.
